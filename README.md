### Employee Payroll Tracker

## Functionallity
```
This webpage will create a table of employees to keep track of salaries.
To add an employee to the table select 'Add Employee'.
Then enter the first name, last name, and salary of the employee.
It will ask if you want to add another, select 'OK' if you do.
When you are done all the employees will be displayed on the table with their first name, last name, and salary.
It will also log the average salary in the console along with a random employee selected at random.
```
## User Story

```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button

WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue

```
## Summary
I was given starter code of an non-functioning employee payroll tracker. I added javascript to it in order for the 'Add Employees' button to work. It also averages up all the salaries and picks a random employee and logs it in the console.
